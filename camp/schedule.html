  <h1>
    The Schedule
  </h1>
  <p>This schedule will be updated as we get closer to the event.</p>

  <p>When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to our remote destination.  The airports nearest to the ranch are: </p>
  <ul class="plain-list">
    <li>San Luis Obispo (SLO) - Approximately 1 hour</li>
    <li>Los Angeles (LAX) - Approximately 3 - 4.5 hours depending on traffic</li>
    <li>San Francisco (SFO) - Approximately 4.5 hours, but an easier drive than from LA</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Friday, November 4 – arrive and get comfy</h2>
  <p>Campers may arrive at the ranch between 4:00pm and 7:00pm to start getting settled and exploring the property. Dinner will start promptly at 7:00, followed by a welcome from your organizers.</p>

  <h2>Saturday, November 5 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h2>
  <p>Topics for unconference sessions will be proposed and voted on by campers on site, and participants have the opportunity to present 5-minute passion talks on any topic they're excited about (hobbies, tech, cats, etc.).  Bring your ideas for both!</p>

  <h2>Sunday, November 6 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h2>
  <p>Unconference sessions and passion talks continue, with time mixed in as always for conversation and relaxation. Sessions will end before dinner on Sunday, should anyone need to leave us early.</p>

  <h2>Monday, November 7 – head home</h2>
  <p>Head home around 11:00am, after breakfast and a final group standup.</p>
