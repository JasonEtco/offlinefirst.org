  <h2>
    The Schedule
  </h2>
 
  <p>When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to our remote destination so you can <b>arrive between 4:00 - 6:30pm on Friday</b> and <b>depart around 11:00am on Monday</b>. (Official discussions end by 7:00pm on Sunday if you must leave us early, but we really hope you'll stick around through Monday breakfast.) The airports nearest to the ranch are: </p>
  <p>&#183; San Luis Obispo (SBP) - Approximately 1 hour<br>
  &#183; Los Angeles (LAX) - Approximately 3 - 4.5 hours depending on traffic<br>
  &#183; San Francisco (SFO) - Approximately 4.5 hours, but an easier drive than from LA<br></p>
