  <h2>
    The Schedule
  </h2>
  <p>This schedule will be updated as we get closer to the event.</p>
  
  <p>When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to our remote destination.  The airports nearest to the ranch are: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>San Luis Obispo (SBP) - Approximately 1 hour</li>
  <li>Los Angeles (LAX) - Approximately 3 - 4.5 hours depending on traffic</li>
  <li>San Francisco (SFO) - Approximately 4.5 hours, but an easier drive than from LA</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Friday, November 4 – arrive and get comfy</h3>
  <p>Campers may arrive at the ranch between 4:00pm and 6:30pm to start getting settled and exploring the property. Dinner will start promptly at 7:00, followed by a welcome from your organizers.</p>
  
  <h3>Saturday, November 5 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h3>
  <p>Topics for unconference sessions will be proposed and voted on by campers on site, and participants have the opportunity to present 5-minute passion talks on any topic they're excited about (hobbies, tech, cats, etc.).  Bring your ideas for both!</p>
  
  <h3>Sunday, November 6 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h3>
  <p>Unconference sessions and passion talks continue, with time mixed in as always for conversation and relaxation. Sessions will end before dinner on Sunday, should anyone need to leave us early.</p>
  
  <h3>Monday, November 7 – head home</h3>
  <p>Head home around 11:00am, after breakfast and a final group standup.</p>
  <p>
    <b>More schedule info will be coming soon!</b>
