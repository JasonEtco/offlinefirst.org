  <h1>The Schedule</h1>

  <p>First things first. When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to our somewhat remote destination. Hop over to our <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/faq.html#location">FAQ</a> for more info. </p>

  <p>Here's a quick look at what we have in store for you at Offline Camp. We'll share more detail as we get closer to the event.</p>

  <h2>Friday, April 28 – Arrive and get comfy</h2>
  <p>Campers may arrive at the ranch between 5:00 pm and 6:30 pm to start getting settled and exploring the property. Dinner will start promptly at 7:00 pm, followed by a welcome from your organizers.</p>

  <h2>Saturday, April 29 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h2>
  <p>Topics for <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/faq.html#unconference">unconference sessions</a> will be proposed and voted on by campers on site, and participants have the opportunity to present 5-minute <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/faq.html#passion">passion talks</a> on any topic they're excited about.  Bring your ideas for both!</p>

  <h2>Sunday, April 30 – Unconference sessions, passion talks, and more</h2>
  <p>Unconference sessions and passion talks continue, with time mixed in as always for conversation and relaxation. Sessions will end before dinner on Sunday, should anyone need to leave us early.</p>

  <h2>Monday, May 1 – Head home</h2>
  <p>Head home around 11:00 am, after breakfast and a final group standup.</p>
