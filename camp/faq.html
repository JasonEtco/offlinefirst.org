  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>What should I expect from Offline Camp?</h2>

  <h3>The atmosphere</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp is relaxed-yet-productive weekend with others passionate about Offline First, engaged in deep discussion and lighthearted fun. We aim to provide a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for a diverse group of participants (per our code of conduct). We also limit the group to 30 people.</p>

  <h3>Unconference sessions</h3>
  <p>Our content is driven by campers, with attendees nominating and voting on Offline First topics to be discussed in unconference sessions. There are multiple discussions on wide-ranging topics happening simultaneously, with group recaps to catch you up on sessions you’ve missed. (Many of our past discussion topics are chronicled in our Medium publication.) Please bring ideas on specific topics you’d like to discuss with the group.</p>

  <h3>Passion talks</h3>
  <p>We also offer campers the opportunity to present 5-minute passion talks on their diverse interests. These informal talks don’t need to be related to Offline First, nor to be technical. If you have a hobby or other pursuit you’re excited about, we look forward to hearing about it! (Videos of many of our past passion talks have been shared with campers’ permission on our Medium publication.)</p>

  <h3>Conversation and relaxation</h3>
  <p>We believe that the casual conversations we have around the campfire can be as important as our more structured discussions. With that in mind, we leave some free time in the schedule for engaging with your fellow campers in a relaxing setting. Our gorgeous 163-acre ranch is adjacent to the Los Padres National Forest in Central California, and comes complete with awesome lodge, lavender fields, scenic walking/biking trails, outdoor pool, yoga studio, fire pit for s’mores, game room, and more.</p>

  <h2>Location, lodging &amp; grub</h2>

  <h3>Where does Offline Camp California take place? How far away is the nearest airport?</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp California will be hosted at The Lodge at Oak Creek Ranch in Santa Margarita, California (between San Francisco and Los Angeles).  When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to and from your airport of choice. The airports nearest to the ranch are:</p>

  <ul class="plain-list">
    <li>San Luis Obispo (SBP) - Approximately 1 hour</li>
    <li>Los Angeles (LAX) - Approximately 3 - 4.5 hours depending on traffic</li>
    <li>San Francisco (SFO) - Approximately 4.5 hours, but an easier drive than from LA</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When should I arrive/depart?</h3>
  <p>Please plan to arrive between 4:00pm and 6:30pm on Friday, November 4 so you can get settled in and join us for dinner.  We hope that everyone will be able to stay through breakfast on Monday, November 7, departing around 11:00am.  Formal discussions will wrap up just before dinner on Sunday, so if you do have to leave Sunday night or early Monday morning, you can.  But we’ll miss you.  (You can visit our schedule page for a more complete view of the weekend.)</p>

  <h3>Can I carpool to camp?</h3>
  <p>Although we will not be organizing transportation to or from the ranch, you might find that other campers are interested in carpooling. Please join the Offline First Slack team and connect directly with fellow campers in the #camp channel to make arrangements.</p>

  <h3>Do you have driving directions?</h3>
  <p>The Lodge at Oak Creek Ranch is located at 760 Parkhill Road, Santa Margarita, CA. It’s best to approach through Pozo, and we’ll send out a map and driving directions the week prior to the event.  Note that there’s no gas available beyond San Luis Obispo!</p>

  <h3>Will we really be camping?</h3>
  <p>Not in the traditional pitching-a-tent sense, no. We have a bed reserved for you in our lodge or the renovated barn.  But it’s like summer camp in the sense that we will enjoy each other, enjoy nature, and enjoy lots of s’mores.</p>

  <h3>Will we really be offline?</h3>
  <p>Although we’ll be discussing Offline First, we will indeed have internet access available in the lodge. Yes, yes, it’s ironic. We know. If it makes you feel any more authentic, we hear that your cell phone coverage could be extremely spotty.  (There’s a phone in the lodge for emergencies.) Frankly, we think you’ll be so engaged in discussion and s’more-making with your fellow campers that you won’t be tempted to go online other than to post about how jealous everyone else should be.</p>

  <h3>What are the sleeping accommodations like?</h3>
  <p>You will have a bed of your own, but it will most likely be in a bedroom shared with others in our lodge or modernized barn.  (The first to register get the biggest beds!) We will do our best to accommodate preferences for sharing bedrooms with others of specific genders, as shared on our Camper Info Form. Co-ed, private bathrooms will be shared with your fellow campers.  Sheets, blankets, pillows, bath towels, basic bath amenities (shampoo, soap, etc.), and pool towels are provided.</p>

  <h3>What meals are provided? Can you accommodate dietary restrictions?</h3>
  <p>We will provide breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages from Friday dinner through Monday breakfast.  (You are welcome to bring your own favorite beverages to enjoy with moderation, per our code of conduct.) When you complete your Camper Info Form, please share any allergies or dietary restrictions.  We will have vegetarian options available at every meal, and Chef Anthony will strive to accommodate other needs as shared on your form in advance of the event.</p>

  <h2>Odds &amp; Ends</h2>

  <h3>What should I pack?</h3>
  <p>We’ll share a recommended packing list about a week before the event. If you enjoy yoga, pack your yoga clothes (mats provided) – we’ll have an awesome instructor with us on site.  Note that sheets, blankets, pillows, bath towels, basic bath amenities (shampoo, soap, etc.), and pool towels are all provided for you.</p>

  <h3>Do you have a Code of Conduct?</h3>
  <p>Yes, and we are dedicated to creating a safe and welcoming environment for all campers.  All guests are asked to review the code of conduct before registering for camp, and our organizing team is available to address any concerns on site.</p>

  <h3>Who else is coming to camp? How can we connect?</h3>
  <p>We don’t share campers’ email addresses, even with our sponsors.  Instead, we encourage you to follow your fellow campers on Twitter, as well as to join the Offline First Slack team and connect with other campers in the #camp channel before, during, and after camp.</p>

  <h3>How can I support Offline Camp?</h3>
  <p>Generous sponsors enable us to make Offline Camp possible. Please encourage your company to sponsor, or make a personal donation to our scholarship fund so we can bring more awesome folks to camp.</p>

  <h3>Where can I learn more about Offline First before camp?</h3>
  <p>Check out offlinefirst.org for a variety of resources including news, case studies, and event listings. You can also find videos of past conference presentations on our YouTube channel. The Offline Camp Medium publication includes recaps of unconference discussions topics from our past camps, as well as videos and background info on passion talks. And of course you can find plenty of #OfflineFirst content shared on Twitter.</p>
