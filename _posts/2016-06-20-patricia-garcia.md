### What do you find interesting about the concept of Offline First?

Nowadays it seems to be assumed that Internet connection is available everywhere, all the time, but it is not, quite the opposite, it’s just available often enough for us to count on it, and to find out too late that there is some useful information we can’t access because it’s not stored offline. That’s why Offline First is so important.

### What motivated you to attend Offline Camp?

I’d love to meet other people that work with Offline First too and that have to face the same challenges I do.

### Who are you looking forward to meeting at Offline Camp, and why?

Everybody, because I am sure everybody will be awesome ;-).

### What do you hope to be an outcome of Offline Camp?

Meeting the other attendees, and maybe help shaping the future of Offline First too.

### Can you describe what Offline First means to you in a sentence?

Being able to stop caring about if Internet is available or not when using my computer or phone, and know that the users of the apps I develop can have the same experience.
